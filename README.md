The project is about analyzing data to help my company's developers to understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. We want to make data-driven decisions, and since the company only builds apps that are free to download and install (revenues come from in-app ads), we need large number of users per app. Our goal is to analyze which kind of apps are the ones which attract more users.

The sources for data come from Kaggle. There are two data sets, one for Google Play and the other for iOS App Store.

The notebook contains a detailed analytics on the csv files. This notebook is introduced by a table of contents.
